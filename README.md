# README

StoryDoc is an app designed for documentarians (documentary photographers).  At the most basic level, a user will be able to package their work (both photography and any corresponding writing) into a singular blog post, which will create a more efficient way for the user to showcase their projects.

This project was built entirely in Rails, with additional gems added (devise, ajaxful_rating**, carrierwave**).
    ** I was unable to successfully utilize the features of carrierwave and ajaxful_rating by submission time **

Unsolved Issues (due to time-constraints):
- was not able to get photo uploading operational
- was not able to get rating system operational
- was not able to properly display a documentarian's frequently used themes on their show page. (so I removed the line)

Additional Things I Would Like To Implement At A Later Date:
- add a field that allows the documentarian to accept donations toward the project.
- add a keyword search (by themes)
- better styling
