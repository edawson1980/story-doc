StoryDoc

With the end in mind:

User will have stories stored on the app.  Stories are comprised of photos and posts, organized under the banner of a common theme.

	think: Instagram, GitHub and Kickstarter combined.

MVP:
- functional HTML and CSS
- user has individual “repo” for projects/stories
- 2 models.  Documentarian and Story.  One-to-many relationship.
- full CRUD functionality.


USER STORIES (going forward, ‘story’ or ‘stories’ will be understood to be one-dimensional):

- user will be able to add text to their story in a blog post format.
- user will be able to add images in order to illustrate their story
- user will be able to rate other users’ stories
- user will be able to fundraise for their stories through a link on the story page.
- user will be able to donate to stories they find compelling.
- user will be able to store their completed stories together in one place.
